<h2>Archery Indroduction</h2>
<h3>History of Archery</h3>
<p>
	Archery, or the use of bow and arrows, was developed by the end of the Upper Paleolithic. Archery has been an important military and hunting skill for over 10,000 years and figures prominently in the mythologies of many cultures.
	Archers, whether on foot, in chariots or mounted on horses were a major part of most military forces until they began being gradually supplemented, then replaced, by firearms in the Late Middle Ages and in the early modern period.
	Gunpowder, which was first developed in China in the 9th century AD, was initially used to enhance projectile weapons including arrows. Firearms diffused throughout Eurasia by the gunpowder empires, gradually reducing the importance of archery in warfare.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Nonetheless, archery is still practiced today, including in the training regime of certain special forces. It also continues to be a popular sport, most commonly in the form of target archery, but in some places also for hunting.

<h3>Target Archery</h3>
<p>
	Target archery is the most popular form of archery, in which members shoot at stationary circular targets at varying distances. 
	All types of bow – longbow, barebow, recurve and compound – can be used. In Great Britain, imperial rounds, measured in yards, are still used for many tournaments and these have slightly different rules to metric (WA) rounds, which are used internationally. 
	Archers are divided into seniors and juniors, with juniors being those under the age of 18.
</p>

<h3>Field Archery/Hunting</h3>
<p>
	Field archery involves shooting at targets of varying and often unmarked distance, typically in woodland and rough terrain. 
	As well as being a sport in its own right, it can be used to improve the techniques and abilities required for bowhunting in a realistic outdoor setting. 
	Archers sometimes refer to the additional skills required to deal with challenging terrain and lighting as "fieldcraft".

<h2>Arrows</h2>
<p>
	AThere is a lot to know about the different types of arrows available for archery.
	Here is the basics to help you understand the differences between them so that you can choose the right ones for you.
	<br/>
</p>

<h3>Arrows Terms</h3>
	<div class="content">

		<p> 
			<strong>Arrow Spine</strong>
        		<br>
			Arrow spine is the word that describes the stiffness of an arrow.  
			When you loose an arrow from the bow, it undergoes compression and will bend either a little or a lot.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</p>

	
	
		<p>
			<strong>Fletchings</strong> 
			<br/>
			Most fletchings are plastic vanes but they can also be made from feathers.  
			These give an arrow stability in the air and allows you to have great accuracy. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Compound Bow</strong> 
			<br/>
			Compound bows were invented in the 1960s and are the most modern archery bow type. 
			They utilise an innovative system of cables, pulleys and eccentric cams to assist the archer in holding a heavy draw weight. 
			While drawing the bow still requires a good deal of strength, the pulley system kicks in at full draw and helps the archer hold the draw weight for a longer period of time,
			without excessive muscle fatigue, so that they can focus on aiming.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<strong>Inserts, nocks, and arrow tips</strong> 
			<br/>
			The part of an arrow that attaches to the back and to the string is the nock.  
			Nocks are important, but the main thing is to make sure that they are just keep the arrow on the string without being too tight or too loose.
			<br/>
			An insert goes in the front end of the arrow and lets you change out arrow tips.  
			Arrows are cut to the length desired and then the insert is glued in permanently.  Some arrows will have the tip glued on and can not be changed.
			<br/>
			Arrow tips are the pointy business end of the arrow.  
			Field points, or target tips, are the ones you’ll normally see on arrows at an archery range.  Hunting tips, or broadheads, are made for hunting animals and are very dangerous
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Balance</strong> 
			<br/>
			An arrow’s weight is normally measured in grams.  
			Weight can be added to the arrow, taken away, and moved from the front to the back.  
			Moving and adjusting weight will affect the way the arrow flies and how it handles obstacles. 
			<br/>

<h3>Types of arrows</h3>

	Selecting the right arrow for your shooting style and the bow is one of the most important steps in getting the perfect shot. 
	If you’re planning on doing some simple target-practice, you’ll need an arrow that is different from the one needed for deer hunting. 
	Following are some of the different types of arrows available today:
	<ul>
  		<li>Wood Arrows - cheapest and most cost-effective </li>
		<li>Aluminum Arrows - cheaper as compared to carbon arrows</li>
		<li>Carbon Arrows - an ideal option for heavier bows</li>
		<li>Fiberglass Arrows - ideal for backyard target-practice, informal uses, and hunting</li>
		
	</ul>

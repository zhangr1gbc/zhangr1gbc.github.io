<h2>Field Archery/Hunting</h2>
<p>
	Field archery is the format of modern archery that takes place on a multi-target course (often compared to a golf course) set out over all kinds of terrain including fields, woods and forests.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	International field archery includes three bowstyles: recurve, compound and barebow. Field archery is included in the programme of the World Games for recurve and barebow athletes (along with compound target archery).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Events are usually conducted according to the rules of either the International Field Archery Association (IFAA)[2] or the World Archery Federation (WA). Others may be held under the rules of national organisations such as the UK National Field Archery Society (NFAS) and the US National Field Archery Association (NFAA).
</p>

<h3>IFAA/NFAA</h3>
<p>
	International Field Archery Association (IFAA) and US National Field Archery Association (NFAA)[3] competitions include three rounds: field, hunter, and animal. A round consists of 28 targets in two units of 14.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<ul>
  		<li><strong>Field rounds</strong>:use targets with a black inner ring, two white middle rings and two black outer rings at 'even' distances up to 80 yards (75 m). </li>
  		<li><strong>Hunter rounds </strong>: use target with all-black face with a white bullseye at 'uneven' distances up to 70 yards (65 m).</li>
  		<li><strong>Animal rounds</strong>: use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round.</li>
  		<li><strong>3D rounds</strong>:use life-size models of game animals such as deer. </li>
  		
</ul>
	

</p>


<h3>Hunting</h3>
<p>
	Bowhunting (or bow hunting) is the practice of hunting game animals by archery. Many indigenous peoples have employed the technique as their primary hunting method for thousands of years, and it has survived into contemporary use for sport and hunting.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In US, bowhunting is regulated by individual provinces and states. Regulations often address issues such as which area to hunt in, what time of year (season), and which sex and species of game may be taken.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Archers usually restrict shots to 2.3 to 42 yards (2 to 38 m). The distance depends upon individual ability, the target animal, the bow strength, terrain, arrow and weather.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Some are deeply opposed to bow hunting in particular, on the grounds of cruelty.

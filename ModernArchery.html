<h2>Modern Archery</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Modern competitive archery</strong> involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy and precision from a set distance or distances.
	This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called target archery. 
	A form particularly popular in Europe and America is field archery, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting.
	There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The World Archery Federation (WA, also and formerly known as FITA from the French Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc), composed of 156 national federations and other archery associations, is the governing body recognized by the International Olympic Committee.

<ul>
  <li><strong>North Africa</strong>: The ancient Egyptian people took to archery as early as 5,000 years ago. Archery was widespread by the time of the earliest pharaohs and was practiced both for hunting and use in warfare. Legendary figures from the tombs of Thebes are depicted giving "lessons in archery".[24] Some Egyptian deities are also connected to archery.</li>
  <li><strong>Mesopotamia</strong>: The Assyrians and Babylonians extensively used the bow and arrow for hunting and warfare. The empires in ancient Mesopotamia formed the first standing armies used exclusively for warfare. This included soldiers trained and employed as archers. The archers served as an integral division of the military and was used on foot and on chariots.</li>
  <li><strong>Eurasian Steppes</strong>: The composite bow was first produced in the Eurasian Steppes during the Bronze Age, and from there it diffused throughout the Old World. The nomads from the Eurasian steppes are believed to play an integral part in introducing the compound bow to other civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Iran, India, East Asia, and Europe. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BC.</li>
  <li><strong>India</strong>: The use of bow and arrow was recorded extensively throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent, starting from the Vedic period. Vedic hymns in the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda lay emphasis on the use of the bow and arrow. </li>
  <li><strong>Greco-Roman antiquity</strong>: The people of Crete practiced archery and Cretan mercenary archers were in great demand.[33] Crete was known for its unbroken tradition of archery.[34]</li>
  <li><strong>East Asia</strong>: For millennia, archery has played a pivotal role in Chinese history.[38] In particular, archery featured prominently in ancient Chinese culture and philosophy: archery was one of the Six Noble Arts of the Zhou dynasty (1146–256 BC); archery skill was a virtue for Chinese emperors</li>
